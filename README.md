# Regression_analysis_Decision_trees
Data:
You will be working with the "Life Expectancy" dataset. This dataset contains
multiple health-related and environmental factors from various countries,
collected over several years.
Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset into a suitable Python data structure.
Perform necessary data cleaning processes, including handling missing
values and data type conversions.
Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset’s
characteristics.
2. Data Splitting:
Split the data into training and testing sets using an appropriate strategy
(e.g., 80/20 split).
3. Regression Model:
Final project 2
Train a regression model using the training data. You may choose a linear
regression model as your base model.
Evaluate the performance of your model on the training set using metrics
like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.
4. Decision Tree Model:
Train a decision tree model using the same training data.
Evaluate its performance using the same metrics as for the regression
model.
5. Model Comparison and Visualization:
Compare the performance of both models using the testing data.
Plot the predictions of both models against the ground truth values for
visual comparison.
6. Understanding R² (R-squared):
Research and explain the concept of R-squared as a metric for regression
analysis. Discuss its advantages and limitations.
7. Report Writing Using LaTeX:
Write a detailed report summarizing your methodology, analysis, results,
and conclusions.
Use LaTeX to format your document, including sections, figures, tables,
and references.
Include visual aids like graphs and tables to support your analysis.
Discuss any interesting patterns or insights that you observed during the
analysis
